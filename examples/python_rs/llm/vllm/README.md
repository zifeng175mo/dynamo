# vLLM Integration with Triton Distributed

This example demonstrates how to use Triton Distributed to serve large language models with the vLLM engine, enabling efficient model serving with both monolithic and disaggregated deployment options.

## Prerequisites

1. Follow the setup instructions in the Python bindings [README](/runtime/rust/python-wheel/README.md) to prepare your environment

2. Install vLLM:
    ```bash
    uv pip install vllm==0.7.2
    ```

3. Start required services (etcd and NATS):

   Option A: Using [Docker Compose](/runtime/rust/docker-compose.yml) (Recommended)
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   Option B: Manual Setup

    - [NATS.io](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/introduction/installation) server with [Jetstream](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/jetstream)
        - example: `nats-server -js --trace`
    - [etcd](https://etcd.io) server
        - follow instructions in [etcd installation](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/install/) to start an `etcd-server` locally

## Deployment Options

### 1. Monolithic Deployment

Run the server and client components in separate terminal sessions:

**Terminal 1 - Server:**
```bash
python3 -m monolith.worker \
    --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B \
    --max-model-len 100 \
    --enforce-eager
```

**Terminal 2 - Client:**
```bash
python3 -m common.client \
    --prompt "what is the capital of france?" \
    --max-tokens 10 \
    --temperature 0.5
```

The output should look similar to:
```
Annotated(data=' Well', event=None, comment=[], id=None)
Annotated(data=' Well,', event=None, comment=[], id=None)
Annotated(data=' Well, France', event=None, comment=[], id=None)
Annotated(data=' Well, France is', event=None, comment=[], id=None)
Annotated(data=' Well, France is a', event=None, comment=[], id=None)
Annotated(data=' Well, France is a country', event=None, comment=[], id=None)
Annotated(data=' Well, France is a country located', event=None, comment=[], id=None)
Annotated(data=' Well, France is a country located in', event=None, comment=[], id=None)
Annotated(data=' Well, France is a country located in Western', event=None, comment=[], id=None)
Annotated(data=' Well, France is a country located in Western Europe', event=None, comment=[], id=None)
```


### 2. Disaggregated Deployment

This deployment option splits the model serving across prefill and decode workers, enabling more efficient resource utilization.

**Terminal 1 - Prefill Worker:**
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 -m disaggregated.prefill_worker \
    --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B \
    --max-model-len 100 \
    --gpu-memory-utilization 0.8 \
    --enforce-eager \
    --kv-transfer-config \
    '{"kv_connector":"PyNcclConnector","kv_role":"kv_producer","kv_rank":0,"kv_parallel_size":2}'
```

**Terminal 2 - Decode Worker:**
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python3 -m disaggregated.decode_worker \
    --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B \
    --max-model-len 100 \
    --gpu-memory-utilization 0.8 \
    --enforce-eager \
    --kv-transfer-config \
    '{"kv_connector":"PyNcclConnector","kv_role":"kv_consumer","kv_rank":1,"kv_parallel_size":2}'
```

**Terminal 3 - Client:**
```bash
python3 -m common.client \
    --prompt "what is the capital of france?" \
    --max-tokens 10 \
    --temperature 0.5
```

The disaggregated deployment utilizes separate GPUs for prefill and decode operations, allowing for optimized resource allocation and improved performance. For more details on the disaggregated deployment, please refer to the [vLLM documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/features/disagg_prefill.html).



### 3. Multi-Node Deployment

The vLLM workers can be deployed across multiple nodes by configuring the NATS and etcd connection endpoints through environment variables. This enables distributed inference across a cluster.

Set the following environment variables on each node before running the workers:

```bash
export NATS_SERVER="nats://<nats-server-host>:<nats-server-port>"
export ETCD_ENDPOINTS="http://<etcd-server-host1>:<etcd-server-port>,http://<etcd-server-host2>:<etcd-server-port>",...
```

For disaggregated deployment, you will also need to pass the `kv_ip` and `kv_port` to the workers in the `kv_transfer_config` argument:

```bash
...
    --kv-transfer-config \
    '{"kv_connector":"PyNcclConnector","kv_role":"kv_producer","kv_rank":<rank>,"kv_parallel_size":2,"kv_ip":<master_node_ip>,"kv_port":<kv_port>}'
```
